# Project ADAM
Project Auxillary Dynamic Alert Monitor (ADAM) is a monitoring system that takes in inputs from a series of screens and process it accordingly.

## Problem Statement

## Introduction
We utilise a series of hardware components to help pipe all the screens that we are monitoring into one desktop, where a series of software 
will process these screens and based on the keywords provided by the user, an alert will pop up. This helps to reduce the strain on the monitoring crew which is required to constantly look at the whole set of screens.

## Overview
The overall set up is as shown in the image below.

### Hardware Component
In this project, our main hardware components consist of the USB-HDMI Capture Card and a desktop, which we term as the Central Computer.
